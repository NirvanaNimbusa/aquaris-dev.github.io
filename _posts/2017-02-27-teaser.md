We've got a little teaser to show you what we've been up to.

![tenshi]({{ site.url }}/images/tenshi-cm13.jpg)

Feel free to submit patches to our projects (see the contribute page) (or even [tenshi](https://github.com/aquaris-dev/android_device_bq_tenshi) if you are a developer..

Users of our [current devices](http://aquaris-dev.org/devices.html) should not feel left out as we're still hard at work with cm-13.0/cm-14.1 projects.

We even have [official weeklies](https://download.lineageos.org) of LineageOS for some of these (paella, piccolo, vegetalte) supported devices.
