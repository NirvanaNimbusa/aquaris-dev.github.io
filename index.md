## What is Aquaris-dev?

Aquaris-dev is a group of independent Android developers whose members voluntarily work on [BQ](https://www.bq.com/) Aquaris devices as official maintainers of the [LineageOS](http://lineageos.org/) Android <nobr>custom ROM</nobr>. We aim to provide the newest version of Android (LineageOS) for as many of the latest BQ Aquaris devices. We contribute our work to the LineageOS project (previously, we worked on CyanogenMod).

### Which devices do we support?

We only support Qualcomm based BQ devices like: <nobr>Aquaris E5 LTE (vegetalte)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris M5 (piccolo)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris X5 (paella)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris X5 Plus (gohan)</nobr>. 

We plan to support other Qualcomm BQ devices (U series) in the future with our LineageOS Android project. 

### Where can you get our work?

Official nightly builds and stable releases can be downloaded on the [LineageOS download](https://download.lineageos.org) page. 

We also have active forum threads incl. installation instructions and download links on [htcmania.com](http://www.htcmania.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2091) for Spanish speaking users and on [android-hilfe.de](http://www.android-hilfe.de/forum/bq-forum.2047/) for German speaking users. 

### OMG, I found a bug/issue &ndash; help!!

Sorry to hear that! We put a lot of effort into building our releases, but we'd always like to be better. Please report bugs on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for the corresponding device project, and we can look into it ASAP!

### Is the source code available?

Absolutely! Android is an open source project, and so is ours. All code used to build our ROMs is available on GitHub, either directly from us at [Aquaris-dev](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for device specific projects or as part of [LineageOS](https://github.com/lineageos) for the main system.

### Who are we?

Aquaris-dev currently is a collaboration of the following developers from the following countries (handle first, then real name) by alphabetical order: 

- brinlyau - Brinly Taylor {% include au.html %}

- cmorlok - Christian Morlok {% include de.html %} {% include ch.html %}

- eloimuns - Eloi Carracedo {% include es.html %}

- kra1o5 - Alejandro {% include es.html %}

- stucki - Michael Stucki {% include de.html %} {% include ch.html %}

We're an international group of developers and we welcome Android developers to contribute (see below). 

### Exciting, but how can I help out?

Since we're an open source project, you can help out by submitting a patch either as a pull request to our GitHub [repo/organization](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for WiP projects (devices etc.) or to the LineageOS [Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/status:open) instance for officially supported projects. 

Supplying good bug reports (logs, screenshots, reproduction steps) helps us to track down issues. We're excited for your contribution to make Android even better on BQ devices.
