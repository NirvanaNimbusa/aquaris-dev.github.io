## What is aquaris-dev?

Aquaris-dev is a group of independent Android developers whose members voluntarily work on [BQ](https://www.bq.com/) Aquaris devices as official maintainers of the [LineageOS](https://github.com/lineageos) Android custom ROM. We aim to provide the newest version of Android (LineageOS) for as many of the latest Aquaris devices. We contribute our work to the LineageOS project (previously, we worked on CyanogenMod).

### Which devices do we support?

We only support Qualcomm based BQ devices like: Aquaris E5 LTE (vegetalte), M5 (piccolo), X5 (paella), X5 Plus (gohan). 

We plan to support other Qualcomm BQ devices (U series) in the future with our LineageOS android project. 

### Where can you get our work?

We have active forum threads, [htcmania.com](http://www.htcmania.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2091) for Spanish users and [android-hilfe.de](http://www.android-hilfe.de/forum/bq-forum.2047/) for Deutsch users. 
Both contain WIP projects and direct download link on the [LineageOS download page](https://download.lineageos.org) for official projects.

### OMG, I found a bug/issue - help!!

Sorry to hear that, we put a lot of effort into building our releases but we'd always like to be better so please report bugs on our GitHub issue page (link here) and we can look into it ASAP!

### Is the source code available?

Absolutely! Android is an open source project, and so is ours. All code used to build our ROMs is available on GitHub, either directly from us at [aquaris-dev](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for WIP projects or as part of LineageOS.

### Who are we? 

Aaquaris-dev currently is a collaboration of the following developers from the following countries (handle first, then real name) by alphabetical order: 

- brinlyau - Brinly Taylor {% include au.html %}

- cmorlok - Christian Morlok {% include de.html %} {% include ch.html %}

- eloimuns - Eloi Carracedo {% include es.html %}

- kra1o5 - Alejandro {% include es.html %}

- stucki - Michael Stucki {% include de.html %} {% include ch.html %}

As you can see, we're an international group of developers and we welcome Android developers to contribute (see below). 

### Exciting, but how can I help out? 

Since we're an open source developers, you can help out by submitting a patch either as a pull request to our GitHub [repo/organization](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for WIP projects (devices etc) or to the LineageOS [gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/status:open) instance for officially supported projects. Supplying good bug reports (logs/screenshots/repro steps) helps to track down issues.  We're excited for your contribution to make Android better on BQ devices.
